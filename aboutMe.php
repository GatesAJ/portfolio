    <div id="aboutMe">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly I would like to say that I have a wife and two sons, one is 13 and the other is 9. 
        My oldest enjoys playing Basketball and my youngest plays Hockey.
        As for myself I like to spend time with my family, going out and enjoying the great outdoors, 
        learning different coding languages and of course gaming when I can. <br/><br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had a plethora of different jobs in my life from Warehouse Worker / Manager to Mover to Militray Service. 
        But having injured my back as a Mover I decided to go back to school for something that I have always had an interest in, Coding. <br/><br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was while I was in a Mobile Development class one day that I realised I really did enjoy coding. No in fact loved it. 
        I found that no matter how many road blocks I hit or how many times I had to bash my head against the wall trying to sort 
        out a problem, as soon as I found the answer to fix my issue the enjoyment came right back.<br/><br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I graduated from my program at school I was employed by a Company out of Ontario as a PHP Developer / Tech Support. 
        I will admit my PHP skills were just enjoy to get me a decent grade and pass in school so having a job using PHP
        was interesting. By the time I was done with the Company I had come to realize I liked using PHP and also RegEx. 
        RegEx used to be the devil's work that was just pure magic in my eyes until I started to use it then I have to say...
        it felt good becoming a Great Wizard that could work Magic with RegEx.<br/><br/>
